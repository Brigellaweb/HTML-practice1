# Day 1 – Frontend Development Journey 🚀

Today marks the beginning of my Frontend Web Development journey!

### 📚 What I Learned

- The role of `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`
- How to create links and buttons using `<a>` and `<button>`

### 🛠️ What I Built

- Practiced linking between pages and using basic button elements

### 🌱 Notes to Myself

- Push every lesson to GitHub  
- Build small practice projects along the way

More coming soon… 👍
